Libraries IEEE.STD_LOGIC_SIGNED/UNSIGNED replaced by IEEE.NUMERIC_STD.
ALL STD_LOGIC_VECTOR data types have been replaced by UNSIGNED.
The remaining conversions and casts have been converted to NUMERIc_STD.

In architecture_pkg.vhd and architecture_pkg_sim.vhd:
Compiler switch WITH_PROG_RW eliminated. The program memory can only
be written when simulating or during boot load (warmboot = '0').
It can always be read.

In uCore.vhd: WITH_PROG_RW eliminated.

In uCntrl.vhd: Bugfix in op_PLUSST, op_PLUSST2
   reg_addr now defined as SIGNED(reg_addr_width DOWNTO 0) so that
   it can handle the negatve register addresses.
   uAdd.vhd and uMult.vhd merged into uArithmetic.vhd.

objects.fs: New file with OOP mechanism.
See uForth.pdf chapter 9.5. OOP code integrated into microcross.fs.

In image.fs: CRC-file modified for variable data_width, but at
least 16 bits.

First release on GitHub.

New Version number structure:
<4 digit version>_<2 digit data_width>
<major_release><functionality_added><HW_fix><SW_fix>_<data_width>
Use .version to display while debugging.

In architecture_pkg.vhd and architecture_pkg_sim.vhd:
- Simplification and re-arrangment of the architecture Constants.
- Additional number formats implemented in vhdl.fs e.g. 16#C00#.
- data_nibbles renamed octetts.
- dcache_addr_width renamed cache_addr_width.
- pcache_addr_width deleted, its now always equal to prog_addr_width.
  The notion that there may be external program memory available has
  been given up.

In uCntrl.vhd:
- The return stack may now reside in external memory.
  Its base address is defined by constant addr_rstack.
- op_WLOCAL and op_RLOCAL have been abandoned for op_LOCAL, which
  only computes the absolute memory address from a relative return
  stack addr.
- Overflow bugfix in op_SDIVS.

In constants.fs: Compound names in uForth did use the _ character as
separator. This has been replaced by the - character unless a name has
been imported from VHDL verbatim. Example: #c_bitout renamed #c-bitout.

Library.fs: New file that implements uForth's library mechanism.
See uForth.pdf chapter 9.6 "Libraries". Library code integrated into
microcross.fs.

First release (CERN, DESY).

During documentation, several changes have been made to the design.
And a new version identification when displaying
.version: 2<2-digit-design#>_<data_width> e.g. 200_32
